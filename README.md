# Overview of Project
The UFO webpage and dynamic table developed during the intitial phase were functioning as intended, but additional in-depth analysis of UFO sightings was requested. Additional functionality allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time was desired. Additional requested criteria includes date, city, state, country, and shape.

# Results

Welcome to the home screen of The Truth Is Out There webpage. Visitors will be welcomed by message seen in the below image.

To filter, the user simply enters the desired criteria in the respective field. For example, to search for sightings in Florida, the user would type 'fl' in the State field then hit return. See image below.

To apply additional criteria, the user need only add additional criteria to the desired fields. For example, to refine the Florida results further to see spherically shaped UFOs, the user would enter 'sphere' in the Shape field. See image below.
