# Overview of Project
The UFO webpage and dynamic table developed during the intitial phase were functioning as intended, but additional in-depth analysis of UFO sightings was requested. Additional functionality allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time was desired. Additional requested criteria includes date, city, state, country, and shape.

# Results

Welcome to the home screen of The Truth Is Out There webpage. Visitors will be welcomed by message seen in the below image.

Further down on the webpage are the UFO sighting data table and filtering criteria. Users have the option to filter UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and shape. See image below.

To filter, the user simply enters the desired criteria in the respective field. For example, to search for sightings in Florida, the user would type 'fl' in the State field then hit return. See image below.

The UFO sightings results will be filtered down to those occuring in the state of Florida. See image below.

To apply additional criteria, the user need only add additional criteria to the desired fields. For example, to refine the Florida results further to see spherically shaped UFOs, the user would enter 'sphere' in the Shape field. See image below.

The UFO sightings results will be filtered down to occurances of spherical UFOs sighted in the state of Florida. See image below.

# Summary

## Drawbacks
One drawback of this design is the requirement for users to type the criteria in the selected field. This creates the potential for data entry error in the form of mispellings or improperly formatted information.

## Recommendations
* Drop-down lists for each filtering option would greatly improve the webpage. Upon selecting an option in a drop down list, the data table would be filtered to the respective results.
* A "Clear Form" button would be helpful in resetting the filtering form and data table. The button would be located below the form so users could find it easily.
